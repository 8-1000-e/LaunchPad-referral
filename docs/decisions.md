# Decisions Log

## 2026-02-10 — Vanilla Three.js over React Three Fiber
**Context**: Attempted to use @react-three/fiber v9 for 3D bonding curve visualization in hero section.
**Decision**: Use vanilla Three.js (useRef + useEffect + THREE.WebGLRenderer) instead of R3F.
**Rationale**: R3F v9 has a fundamental incompatibility with React 19 + Next.js 16. The `<Canvas>` component crashes with `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'alpha')` regardless of configuration. This is not fixable by removing gl props, adding mount guards, or using dynamic imports with ssr:false.
**Alternatives considered**: Downgrading to R3F v8 (requires React 18 downgrade), waiting for R3F fix (tracked at pmndrs/react-three-fiber#3471).
**Skill created**: `~/.claude/skills/brain-dump/extracted/r3f-react19-nextjs-crash/SKILL.md`

## 2026-02-10 — Webpack over Turbopack for dev server
**Context**: Next.js 16 defaults to Turbopack for dev server. Project has dual lockfiles (root yarn.lock + app/yarn.lock).
**Decision**: Always use `npx next dev --webpack` flag.
**Rationale**: Turbopack enters infinite loop with dual lockfiles. Shows "Ready" but never serves pages. No error in terminal.
**Skill created**: `~/.claude/skills/brain-dump/extracted/nextjs-turbopack-dual-lockfile/SKILL.md`

## 2026-02-10 — No UI libraries (pure Tailwind)
**Context**: Building token launchpad frontend with distinctive design.
**Decision**: Use only Tailwind CSS v4 with @theme inline tokens. No shadcn, Chakra, Radix, etc.
**Rationale**: Boss requirement. Gives full control over aesthetic. Avoids generic component library look.

## 2026-02-10 — Warm gold brand color (#c9a84c)
**Context**: Choosing brand identity for "LAUNCH" token launchpad.
**Decision**: Warm gold (#c9a84c) as primary brand, NOT the typical pump.fun green or generic crypto cyan.
**Rationale**: Distinctive, premium feel. Buy stays green (#22c55e), sell stays red (#ef4444). Gold evokes value/wealth without being generic crypto.

## 2026-02-10 — Two-column hero layout with dashboard widget
**Context**: Boss requested 3D chart be a "first-class element" not buried in background.
**Decision**: Hero section uses `grid-cols-[1fr_1fr]` — text/stats left, chart in dashboard widget right.
**Rationale**: Chart gets proper framing with header (live price) and footer (legend). Looks like a real trading interface.

## 2026-02-10 — V8: Full-screen immersive canvas (replaced dashboard widget)
**Context**: Boss wanted "Shopify Editions" feel — immersive, cinematic.
**Decision**: Chart fills entire hero section as background, content overlays on top.
**Rationale**: More impactful than a boxed widget. Hero text with gradient overlays + transparent WebGL canvas.

## 2026-02-11 — Camera tracking in animation loop, NOT data callbacks
**Context**: Chart tip escaped viewport because camera only updated when new data arrived (2-5fps), not at render speed (60fps).
**Decision**: Set `targetCamX`/`targetCamY` in `rebuildCurve()`, lerp camera in `animate()` with `3.0 * dt`.
**Rationale**: Frame-rate independent smoothing. Camera reaches 95% of target in ~1 second. No more stutter or lag.
**Skill created**: `~/.claude/skills/brain-dump/extracted/threejs-infinite-chart-camera/SKILL.md`

## 2026-02-11 — Relative Y scaling instead of absolute
**Context**: As price grew infinitely, `price / maxPrice * height` compressed the chart to a flat line at the top.
**Decision**: Map visible price range (min→max) to fixed Y range: `((price - minP) / range) * 4.5 + BOTTOM_Y` with `range = max(maxP - minP, 5)`.
**Rationale**: Chart always shows full volatility regardless of absolute price level. Minimum range of 5 prevents flat line during consolidation.

## 2026-02-11 — No graduation reset (infinite chart)
**Context**: Boss wanted truly infinite chart. Old version reset at 85 SOL graduation threshold.
**Decision**: Remove reset entirely. Curve trades forever. Graduation explosion fires once as celebration.
**Rationale**: Removing the reset + relative Y scaling + camera tracking = true infinite scrolling chart.

## 2026-02-11 — 3-layer parallax scroll system
**Context**: Boss wanted Shopify Editions-style cinematic scroll transitions.
**Decision**: Background orbs at 0.3x, 3D canvas at 0.5x, HTML content at 1x. Hero fades+blurs+zooms on scroll.
**Rationale**: Creates depth and premium feel. rAF-throttled scroll listener prevents jank.

## 2026-02-11 — Removed LIVE SOL HUD and candlestick bars
**Context**: User wanted cleaner hero. HUD and candlesticks added visual noise.
**Decision**: Removed price indicator overlay and green/red candle bars. Price data still flows (for 3D animation) but isn't displayed as text.
**Rationale**: Cleaner aesthetic. The 3D curve itself communicates price movement.

## 2026-02-11 — Backend: Pedagogical mode
**Context**: Emile wants to learn by writing the Anchor program himself.
**Decision**: Backend mentor guides and reviews but does NOT write program code unless explicitly asked. Errors/events added incrementally as needed.
**Rationale**: Learning-by-doing approach. Emile has prior Anchor experience (vault-syncit, X-RAY, Arcium) but wants to level up on DeFi/AMM patterns.

## 2026-02-11 — Backend: InitSpace over size_of
**Context**: Emile asked about account space calculation.
**Decision**: Use `#[derive(InitSpace)]` + `8 + Global::INIT_SPACE` instead of `8 + std::mem::size_of::<Global>()`.
**Rationale**: InitSpace calculates Borsh serialization size, which can differ from Rust memory layout. More reliable. Emile was already familiar with this pattern.

## 2026-02-11 — Backend: Handler pattern for instructions
**Context**: Structuring instruction code across files.
**Decision**: Each instruction file exports `pub fn handler(ctx) -> Result<()>` + `#[derive(Accounts)]` struct. `lib.rs` delegates: `instructions::admin::initialize::handler(ctx)`.
**Rationale**: Standard Anchor pattern for multi-file programs. Clean separation of concerns.

## 2026-02-11 — Backend: Errors added as-needed, not pre-planned
**Context**: Emile said "on les fera au fur et à mesure" about errors.rs.
**Decision**: Don't pre-define all errors upfront. Add to errors.rs when each instruction needs them.
**Rationale**: Avoids guessing what errors will be needed. More pragmatic.

## 2026-02-11 — Frontend: Token detail page assigned to designer
**Context**: Landing page V10+ validated by Emile.
**Decision**: Designer agent starts Token Detail / Trade page (`/token/[mint]`) with 2-column layout: chart + stats left, buy/sell form right.
**Rationale**: Most important page of the launchpad — where users actually trade.

## 2026-02-11 — lightweight-charts v5 for token chart
**Context**: Need a TradingView-style chart for the token detail page.
**Decision**: Use `lightweight-charts` v5.1.0 by TradingView. Area series with custom colors matching token.
**Rationale**: Lightweight (~40KB), well-maintained, looks professional. Free/open source. v5 API changed significantly from v4 — uses `chart.addSeries(AreaSeries, {...})` instead of `chart.seriesType()`.

## 2026-02-11 — Removed HowItWorks section from homepage
**Context**: Created a "How it works" 3-step section between hero and token grid.
**Decision**: Removed from page (file still exists). User said "c'est mal placé ici".
**Rationale**: Breaks the flow between the immersive hero and the token grid. Could be re-added on a separate "about" page or below the token grid.

## 2026-02-11 — Removed ActivityTicker (fake trade marquee)
**Context**: Created a marquee-style ticker showing fake "0x7a.. bought 2.5 SOL" messages.
**Decision**: Removed. User found the fake trade text unconvincing ("enleve les dates en mode hdgjhad bough asgda").
**Rationale**: Fake data looks fake. Better to add real websocket data later or skip entirely.

## 2026-02-11 — 5 wow effects for token detail page
**Context**: User wanted the token detail page to feel "insane" with a "whoua effect".
**Decision**: Implemented all 5 proposed effects: odometer price ticker, trade pulse overlay, mini SVG bonding curve, graduation heat (particles + glow), button particle burst.
**Rationale**: Each effect adds a different dimension — typography animation, page-level feedback, data visualization, status-driven atmosphere, and interaction delight. Together they create a highly dynamic trading page.

## 2026-02-11 — Next.js 16 dynamic route params are Promises
**Context**: Building `/token/[id]` page. TypeScript error on `params.id`.
**Decision**: Use `use()` from React to unwrap: `const { id } = use(params)` where `params: Promise<{id: string}>`.
**Rationale**: Next.js 16 changed dynamic route params to be async/Promise-based. This is the correct pattern for client components.

## 2026-02-11 — CSS color swatches: fixed-size over grid-fill
**Context**: Color picker swatches in `/create` page were ovals. Using `w-full` in a `grid-cols-6` makes elements wider than tall, so `border-radius: 50%` creates ovals.
**Decision**: Use `flex flex-wrap gap-2.5` with `h-8 w-8 shrink-0 rounded-full` instead of grid with `w-full`.
**Rationale**: Fixed dimensions guarantee perfect circles. `shrink-0` prevents flex compression.

## 2026-02-11 — Buy on Create: anti-snipe same-transaction pattern
**Context**: "Buy on Create" feature lets creators buy their own token at launch.
**Decision**: Explain it as anti-snipe: "Your buy executes in the same transaction as the token creation, no one can front-run you. Only possible at creation." Custom CSS toggle switch + pill amount selector with brand glow.
**Rationale**: Same-transaction execution is a real security feature (prevents MEV bots from front-running). Framing it as anti-snipe gives users confidence. UI uses custom CSS toggle (round knob on pill track) instead of icon-based toggle for better affordance.

## 2026-02-11 — Leaderboard: CSS 3D trophy over Three.js
**Context**: Leaderboard hero needed a trophy visual element.
**Decision**: Built trophy with pure CSS (gradients, box-shadows, keyframe rotation) instead of a 3D model in Three.js/R3F.
**Rationale**: R3F incompatible with React 19. Loading a 3D model just for a trophy is overkill. CSS trophy with floating particles and rotation animation is lightweight and looks great.

## 2026-02-11 — Leaderboard: holographic Hall of Fame cards
**Context**: Boss wanted "WOW EFFECT" for graduated tokens section.
**Decision**: Horizontal scroll of cards with gold animated border (`gradient-x` keyframe), 3D perspective transform on hover (`perspective(600px) rotateY(-3deg) rotateX(2deg) scale(1.02)`), subtle holographic feel.
**Rationale**: Graduated tokens are the success stories — they deserve special visual treatment. Holographic tilt + gold border creates a "collector's card" feel.

## 2026-02-11 — Animated counters with requestAnimationFrame
**Context**: Leaderboard hero shows stats (total tokens launched, total volume, active traders).
**Decision**: `useAnimatedCounter` hook using `requestAnimationFrame` + ease-out cubic easing (`1 - Math.pow(1 - t, 3)`), animates from 0 to target over 2 seconds.
**Rationale**: Counting up from zero creates a "reveal" moment. rAF ensures smooth 60fps animation. Ease-out cubic feels natural — fast start, smooth landing.
